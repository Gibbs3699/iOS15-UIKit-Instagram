# Firebase Question
### 1. What is the difference between Firebase storage and firestore?
- Realtime database store data only json format and it is specially used in app where data is synchronized concurrently like ola app(user location),sensex(Nifty) app where data not persist .
- Firebase Storage just only store data like memory card.It is specially used for store backend data of app.
### 2. Class VS Static
- class will allocate memory when called and deallocate but static will allocate memory not deallocate.
- enum  will allocate memory when called and deallocate
